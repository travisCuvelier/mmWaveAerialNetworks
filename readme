These scripts were used in the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03295.pdf also available at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8491045.
The arXiv version is as (finally) submitted modulo a small correction in equation (9) that I noticed after publication.

How to use this software:
(This guide is incomplete and under construction)

1) At least skim the paper. Specifically, read the "Analytical Framework" section. 

2) Clone the repo via calling: git clone https://github.com/travisCuvelier/mmWaveAerialNetworks.git

3) The folder "mmWaveAerialNetworks" will appear in your directory.

4) To run experiments that estimate achievable rates in the uplink scenario described in our paper, add mmWaveAerialNetworks and all subfolders to your path in MATLAB. The way I do this is by navigating to 
the directory containing "mmWaveAerialNetworks", right clicking on the folder, and selecting "Add to Path" and then selecting "Selected Folders and Subfolders". Open the script "uplinkExperiments.m" 
in the "mmWaveAerialNetworks" folder, read the comments, set your parameters, and run the thing. The results for every iteration will appear in the "mmWaveAerialNetworks/results" as .mat files.

6) You can find scripts to compute atmospheric specific attenuation in "mmWaveAerialNetworks/atmospheric_specific_attenuation_formulae". You will find the functions in "mmWaveAerialNetworks/meteorological_conversions" 
useful. Furthermore, you can find an atmospheric model from the ITU in "mmWaveAerialNetworks/reference_atmospheres".
